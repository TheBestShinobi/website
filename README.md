This page is for notes/tips while coding using node JS for the first time:


THE PLAN:
- take care of a Ksh website

possible component breakdown:
1. Eating station (learn how to implement drag mechanics)
--> drag food, drinks, napkin to ksh to interact with
2. Excersise station
--> spam space to help her reach destination
(there will be chibi Ksh head at top indicating how far shes gotten)
3. Dress up station
--> can pick through pants, shirts (+ jackets), accesories ect

interactions:
1. feeding Ksh
2. clicking on Ksh
3. dress up Ksh
4. help Ksh exercise
